# About Me
---

My name is Terence Sinn and I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering student at University of Washington. I am interested in a broad range of topics within the computing stack, but I am looking to concentrate in VLSI and Integrated Systems. My current hobbies include playing the piano, tennis, and chess.
